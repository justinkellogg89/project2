## Project Description:

Wild Kards is an application that allows users to enter, and search for quotes from their favorite pseudo celebrities, the Kardashians. Wild Kards also allows users to comment on quotes and enter blog-like posts. The website is gated behind a registration system. New users will be able to view the index page which will contain a 'quote of the day' and a sign up/log in prompt. If the user does neither of these things, they will always be re-directed to the index page.

After signing up/logging in, users will be able to comment on posts, enter their own quotes, search quotes, and write blog posts.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

Our MVP for Wild Kards is having a functional sign-up and login system, randomly selected quotes from an outside API displayed on the index page, and a system for registered users to comment on user-generated quotes that are stored in the database.
